### 🙏 

Currently enrolled in Java Spring Boot and QC Automation courses. 

As I work on my own app, I'm also exploring new ideas, with a self-taught enthusiasm. So far, I've been taking my first steps with GUI, recreating the video game PONG 🏓 with Java Swing, and a Calculator 🧮 with Java FX and CSS.

I'm open to working on and contributing to new projects! 🚀
